## Project Description
Write a short description of your project. Write 1-2 sentences about what what you chose to build and why.
Dungeon Crawler if a turn-based type-to-act game. The Player can choose from three different attacks and a heal. All the monsters and damage are randomly generated. After defeating 10 monsters, the player faces THE_FINAL_BOSS, who has the power to alter the world! (aka, can code) Undertale and the original "The Dungeon" pedit5 game were inspiration.

## Rules
You pick from different actions and aim to kill all the monsters in the dungeon and get the epic loot. If you take too much damage, you will die.

## Workflow
I started by creating the version with only one monster. That version included introducing monster_hp and player_hp variables, asking for valid input from player, random attack values changing current health points and conditions estimating when the game is over (win or lose)
In the second version I added a pool of monsters, adjectives and created 10 fight encounters. Improved the text messages and added healing. In the final version I revined the story, reused the code to create THE_FINAL_BOSS battle, added visuals, and events.

## Organization
I started by doing the simplest version possible, then added things I wanted to practise (random monster names: dictionaries) Finally, once the logic was working, I added things which are simple and do not break the code, but make a cool game (story, better text, visuals, boss battle, events, etc.)

Once I reached a checkpoint (version working) I moved to another file. I created a few files to test and save individual things

In the game I used art that was not created by me! Check asciiart.website and .eu websites and support the creators!
